            I recently decided the take the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/">Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam</a> and passed. Unlike other certification exams, the CKAD exam is 100% hands-on. You are not expected to select an answer from a multiple choice question but instead work on a real Kubernetes cluster. Each question focuses on a practical aspect of using Kubernetes for different use cases. As a result, you'll be able to apply your knowledge to the actual use of Kubernetes in your own projects making the exam a valuable asset in your knowledge portfolio.

Based on my experience with the exam, it's not necessarily straightforward to pass. It's a tough exam and you are under immense time pressure. To give you an idea: You will have to solve 19 scenarios. Out of these 19 scenarios I was only able to solve 17. There's a lot of work that goes into the preparation for the exam.

The most important aspect is practice. You will have to be comfortable with the command line tool `kubectl`. You will have to have a good understanding of all topics stated in the exam outline. In this post, I want to summarize the resources I used to prepare for the CKAD exam. I hope they will help you with succeeding as well.

== Setting up a Kubernetes environment for practice

In order to practice, you'll have to have access to an environment running Kubernetes. This environment doesn't have to be complex and it doesn't have to be a full-fledge cluster. Here're some options:

1. You have access to a cloud provider environment (e.g. GCP). Maybe you already use Kubernetes at work and you can use the account to prepare for the exam.
2. Install https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/[minikube] or some other Kubernetes distribution on your machine.
3. Use one or many Raspberry Pis to build a Kubernetes cluster.

I went with option 2. and 3. For local development, I installed https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop for MacOSX] and enabled the Kubernetes option. To get more comfortable in a cluster environment, I installed Kubernetes master & worker nodes on a set of four Raspberry Pis 3+.

== Learning resources

The only efficient way to ace the CKAD exam is by practicing different scenarios in your Kubernetes environment. There are a couple of free and paid practice exams that can help. I used the two options below:

1. The GitHub repository https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises[dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises] offers a wide range of free practice questions. I worked through the scenarios probably three or four times.
2. Another great resource is the https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/#purchase[practice exam offered by Matthew Palmer]. You'll pay $119 for accessing a GitHub repository containing 30 questions. The practice exam is well made and offers a setup procedure that creates namespaces and existing Kubernetes domain objects to work with.
3. The book https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-patterns/9781492050278/[Kubernetes patterns] helped me brush up on some of the material I was less familiar with. Especially the coverage of multi-container patterns proved to be helpful.

            After passing the exam, I decided to create my own learning resource. In cooperation with O'Reilly Media, I produced a video course, the <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/learning-paths/learning-path-certified/9781492061021/">Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Prep Course</a>, that explains the theory of all topics covered in the exam and reinforces the material with the help of <a href="https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep">practical demos</a>.

== During the exam

There are a couple of things you need to consider for the actual exam. You will be under pressure to finish all questions within 2 hours. Proper time management is extremely important. If you happen to get stuck on a question, simply move on. It's more productive to solve other scenarios that help you score points. You can always come back to a question later during the exam if you have additional time left.

During the exam you are allowed to open one browser tab with the official Kubernetes documentation. While this can be helpful to find particular code snippets, don't get hung up on searching the web page too much. As part of your exam preparation, read the whole documentation page at least once. It's important to know where to find the right information without spending too much time. The search functionality helped me tremendiously.

There are some simple shortcuts and time savers I used during the exam. First of all, use an https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep/blob/master/8-bonus.md#using-an-alias-for-kubectl[alias for the kubectl command]. There's really no point in typing the full command every time you need to run it. Furthermore, ensure to https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep/blob/master/8-bonus.md#setting-the-namespace-per-context[set the proper context and namespace per question]. It helps to set both options at the beginning of every question to avoid forgetting about it in the heat of the moment. You might know that deleting Kubernetes object sometimes takes a couple of seconds. Kubernetes tries to gracefully shut down the resource. In case you need to delete one of your object, simply https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep/blob/master/8-bonus.md#deleting-kubernetes-objects-quickly[force the deletion] to speed up the process.

== Conclusion

I hope I could give a couple of valuable pointers to prepare for the CKAD exam. It took me about four weeks to prepare to feel ready for taking the test. Your preparation time likely vary and depends on your experience with Kubernetes. Remember that you have two attempts to pass the exam with a single voucher. In case you fail the first attempt, you will have a good idea about your weak spots, practicing those more intensely and passing on the second attempt. Good luck!
