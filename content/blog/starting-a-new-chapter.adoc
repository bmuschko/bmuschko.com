The news has been out for over two weeks, but I just got around to writing a blog post about it. April 30th marked my last day at link:https://gradle.com/about[Gradle Inc.], the company behind the open source build tool Gradle and Gradle Enterprise, the complimentary commercial offering.

It's been almost 5 years full of challenges and learning experiences. Over the course of that time, I had the opportunity to help several companies migrate their build environment to Gradle and adopt Continuous Delivery in the process. Training has always been near and dear to my heart. During my time at Gradle, I got to develop new courses on various aspects of the tool, from plugin development to the latest features of the build cache. I am proud to say that I trained hundreds if not thousands of developers. Community interaction has always been important for an open source project. I hope I could leave a mark, guide you toward best practices and help you learn the tool by improving the developer experience.

I say goodbye to an incredibly talented and ambitious team. Most of us worked in different time zones, but I always looked forward to some face time in Hangouts or an in-person meeting.

After some extended time off, I am planning to do independent consulting and training. I am very excited for my next steps and look forward to building new areas of expertise. Let me know if you are mailto:benjamin.muschko@gmail.com[interested in working with me].
