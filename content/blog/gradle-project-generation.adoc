Having to create a `build.gradle` file, a `settings.gradle` file and the necessary project layout manually for ever new Gradle project can be a drag. Gradle provides the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_init_plugin.html[build init plugin] for generating new projects with different flavors from the command line. The downside of this approach is that you already have to have the Gradle runtime installed on your machine. You will likely also have to look up the right combination of command line options from the user manual.

Generating new Gradle projects should be easy, fast-forward and accessible from different user interfaces. link:https://gradle-initializr.cleverapps.io/[Gradle Initializer] provides a web-based service for generating quickstart Gradle projects. The application provides two different interfaces: a web-based UI and an endpoint for generating projects via `curl`. Under the covers, Gradle Initializer uses the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/embedding.html[Tooling API] to invoke the functionality of the build init plugin. A quickstart project is bundled and downloaded as ZIP or TAR file.

The screencast below shows the web interface in action. In this sample, the user creates a Java library project equipped with the build logic to enable testing with Spock. The generated DSL of the build script is based on Kotlin.

Alternatively, you can invoke the `curl` command to generate a project with the same setup from the command line. You can find all relevant options in the link:https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-initializr/blob/master/README.adoc[README file].
