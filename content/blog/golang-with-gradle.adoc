== Introduction

In July 2017 link:https://golang.org/[Google Go] made a link:https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/go/[big jump on the TIOBE index]. It's now ranked among the top 10 most popular programming languages. Suffice to say with the rise of Moby aka Docker, Kubernetes and InfluxDB the language has become the go-to tool in the DevOps space. As with any other medium to large sized project the complexity of automating the process of building, assembling and distributing the source code and binaries is high. It's somewhat shocking to see that the predominant tooling of automating in Go is still a mixture of Make files and shell scripts as it can be observed in the link:https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/Makefile/[Moby] and link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/build/[Kubernetes] code base.

Make files and shell script can be powerful tools but they do not provide any support for strong modeling of a domain, are hard to maintain and do not provide any means to testing the automation code. In this post I'd like to identify if Gradle can live up to the game. We'll look at a simple Go project, some typical challenges and tasks encountered when building this project and how Gradle can help to automate the process.

== How can Gradle help?

Gradle currently does not provide a standard way to build Go project with its core distribution. However, users can write plugins to enhance the functionality by plugins to model new domains. link:https://github.com/gogradle/gogradle[GoGradle] is a plugin that helps with compiling, testing and assembling Go projects. At this year's Gradle Summit, the plugin was awarded the Gradle plugin of the year 2017. For a deep dive on the plugin functionality check out the link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvf3gY1MopE/[recording of the Summit talk on GoGradle].

_Disclaimer:_ I found link:https://github.com/echocat/gradle-golang-plugin[another Gradle plugin for building Go project]. I did not have a chance to compare the functionality and their implementation approaches nor did I have deeper look at the alternative plugin.

== The sample project

image:/img/blog/golang-with-gradle/link-verifier-logo.jpg[float=right]
For the purpose of demonstrating the functionality provided by the GoGradle plugin, we'll have a look at a Go project called link:https://github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier[Link Verifier], a program run from the command line. Functionally, Link Verifier recursively iterates over a given directory and identifies plain-text mark-up files like AsciiDoc and Markdown. For each of the found documents, the program extracts URLs and verifies that they can be resolved by executing a HTTP call.

The project depends on external Go packages: link:https://github.com/mvdan/xurls[xurls] for extract URLs out of a text document and link:https://github.com/stretchr/testify[testify] for conviently making assertions in test code. Both libraries can be resolved with the help of link:https://glide.sh/[Glide], a package manager for Go. A developer working on the project will have to install Glide to properly resolve the declared dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

The project uses Go's built-in support executing tests, the `test` command. Additionally, code coverage metrics are produced by configuring the The `test` command. The project uses link:https://codecov.io/gh/bmuschko/link-verifier[Codecov] to capture and visualize code coverage metrics over time.

The program was designed to run on different OSes e.g. Linux, Windows and MacOSX. For that purpose the project link:https://github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier/releases/[publishes prebuilt libraries] with every single release. To adhere to the license agreements of external packages used by the project, I also wrote some logic for extracting the third-party license agreements and packaging with the corresponding library in a TAR or ZIP file.

Most of the automation steps mentioned above can be executed by invoking a shell script. Every change made to link:https://travis-ci.org/bmuschko/link-verifier/[the project runs through Travis CI]. To reuse automation logic Travis directly calls the shell script checked into version control with the project's source code.

Let's see if the Gradle plugin can fulfill all of those requirements while at the same hiding and simplifying complex implementation logic which otherwise lives in a shell script.

== Initial setup

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.github.blindpirate.gogradle' version '0.6.5'
}

golang {
    packagePath = 'github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier'
}
----

== Managing and resolving dependencies

.glide.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
package: .
import:
- package: github.com/mvdan/xurls
  version: 1.1.0
testImport:
- package: github.com/stretchr/testify
  version: 1.1.4
----

.glide.lock
[source,yaml]

== Cross-compiling binaries

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
build {
    targetPlatform = 'darwin-amd64, netbsd-amd64, netbsd-386, openbsd-amd64, openbsd-386, freebsd-amd64, freebsd-386, linux-amd64, linux-386, linux-arm, windows-amd64, windows-386'
}
