      <description>Recently, JetBrains ran a survey on the state of developer ecosystems. As part of the survey, they asked Go developers about their tools of choice. As I was reading through it, the section on testing frameworks caught my eye. So far I had only used the built-in Go testing support and Testify for my own projects. Time to explore the testing landscape!
 During my research I tried to identify the most popular packages and differentiate them in regards to feature set, usability and expressiveness.</description>
