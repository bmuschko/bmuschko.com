      <description>Asciidoc is a powerful markup language and extensible platform for producing documentation. Sometimes the requirements for producing documentation go beyond its built-in capabilities. Asciidoc enabled content producers to enhance the basic functionality of the platform by writing so-called extensions - think plugin for Asciidoc.
 AsciidoctorJ is the library for running Asciidoctor on the JVM. It comes into play when converting Asciidoc content to the target format (e.g. HTML) from Java.</description>

      <description>TestContainers is a helpful tool for writing integration and functional tests with Docker containers as fixtures. Starting with version 1.10.0, the Java library of TestContainers supports writing and executing tests with JUnit 5, a feature long-awaited by the community. Time to explore the functionality by example!
 In this blog post, you will learn how to build an image for a Java application on-the-fly, start up a container as test fixture and stop it after the test has finished.</description>

      <title>Exploring the landscape of Go testing frameworks</title>

      <description>Recently, JetBrains ran a survey on the state of developer ecosystems. As part of the survey, they asked Go developers about their tools of choice. As I was reading through it, the section on testing frameworks caught my eye. So far I had only used the built-in Go testing support and Testify for my own projects. Time to explore the testing landscape!
 During my research I tried to identify the most popular packages and differentiate them in regards to feature set, usability and expressiveness.</description>

      <title>Docker with Gradle: Integration testing using containers</title>

      <description>In the first blog post on &#34;Docker with Gradle&#34; you learned how to package a Spring Boot application as a Docker image. After verifying that the image works as expected you pushed the image to a registry. Being able to produce and push a new image of an application with every single commit lays the foundation for enabling supplemental automation workflows.
 Integration testing plays an important role in the software development lifecycle to ensure functional and non-functional requirements have been met.</description>

      <title>JUnit 5 vs. Spock feature showdown</title>

      <description>Introduction For over a decade JUnit 4 has been the go-to test framework for JVM-based software projects. You can find the use of JUnit across the board in organizations from big entprises to small startups. Despite its popularity, the test framework&amp;#8217;s features barely moved with the times. Due to its deep penetration among the industry, evolutionary changes became harder and harder to implement without introducing inevidable breakages to the API.</description>
