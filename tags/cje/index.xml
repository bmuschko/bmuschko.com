      <description>Last summer, I decided to take the Certified Jenkins Engineer (CJE) exam. I have years of experience with Jenkins as developer managing my own jobs as well as Jenkins administrator.

The main focus of the certification lies on operating Jenkins pipelines and maintaining them in the context of a larger organization.</description>
